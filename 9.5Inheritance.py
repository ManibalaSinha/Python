#class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base or super classes, a derived class can override
#isinstance() to check an instanceâ€™s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.__class__ is int or some class derived from int.
#issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass of int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.
